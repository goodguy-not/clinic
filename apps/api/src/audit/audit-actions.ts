/**
 * Every audit action this application can write.
 *
 * These live in `apps/api` rather than `@clinic/contracts` because they are
 * server vocabulary: the web tier has no audit surface in Milestone 1 and must
 * not gain the ability to name an action. They will move to contracts only if
 * an audit viewer needs them.
 *
 * `audit_log.action` is TEXT with a format CHECK rather than a PostgreSQL enum,
 * because every later milestone adds actions and an enum would cost an
 * `ALTER TYPE` migration each time — which cannot run in the same transaction
 * that uses the new value.
 *
 * Every action below accompanies a state change written in the same
 * transaction. There is deliberately no summary, aggregate or sampled action:
 * see `security-log.ts` for why non-state-changing rejections are not audited.

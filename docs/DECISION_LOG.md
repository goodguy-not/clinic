## Accepted baseline

### Manual facts, automatic calculations

Receptionist records facts; the system derives sessions, charges, payments, credit/balance, and overdue promises.

### Family-level account

Balance belongs to the family; charge detail identifies the child.

### No online payment or native app initially

Initial value is reliable internal tracking. Parent-facing/native features are reconsidered after workflow and usage evidence.

### Next.js + NestJS direction

Next.js owns public/internal presentation and a selective BFF. NestJS owns PostgreSQL, domain rules, authorization, transactions, and audit. Implementation details remain open to reasoned refinement.




## 2026-08-02 — Group-session charge invariant

**Status:** Accepted

Each appointment participant may have at most one valid primary session charge.
An individual appointment has exactly one participant.

## 2026-08-02 — Therapist settlement basis

**Status:** Accepted

Therapist settlement is based on completed-session value and is independent of
whether or when the family pays.

Payment-to-charge allocation is therefore not required for therapist settlement.

Revisit payment allocation only if future requirements introduce insurance,
third-party payers, per-invoice payment, or another need to identify which
payment settled which charge.

## 2026-08-02 — Therapist share and discount allocation

**Status:** Accepted

Therapist settlement is based on completed-session value and is independent of
whether or when the family pays.

Therapist share percentages may differ by therapist and may change over time.
The percentage applied to a completed participant/session must be preserved as
a historical snapshot.

A family discount is split explicitly between the therapist and the clinic:

- therapist discount amount + clinic discount amount = total family discount;
- therapist net share = therapist gross share - therapist discount amount;
- clinic net share = clinic gross share - clinic discount amount;
- therapist net share must never be negative;
- the family's effective session charge must never be negative;
- clinic net share may be negative when the clinic explicitly bears a discount
  greater than its gross share.

For therapists who do not participate in discounts, therapist discount amount
is zero and the clinic bears the entire family discount, even when this produces
a negative clinic net.

A negative clinic net represents an explicit clinic subsidy or loss. It must be
visible in reports and preserve the applied split, actor, time, and reason.

Defaults may be defined per therapist. Any participant/session-level override
must be explicit, reasoned, and audited.

This decision supersedes any earlier wording that prohibited a negative clinic
net.

# Decision Log

Keep entries concise. Store final decisions, not chat transcripts.

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded  
**Topic:**

- **Decision:**
- **Alternatives:**
- **Reason:**
- **Trade-off:**
- **Assumptions:**
- **Revisit when:**

## Accepted baseline

### Manual facts, automatic calculations

Receptionist records facts; the system derives sessions, charges, payments, credit/balance, and overdue promises.

### Family-level account

Balance belongs to the family; charge detail identifies the child.

### No online payment or native app initially

Initial value is reliable internal tracking. Parent-facing/native features are reconsidered after workflow and usage evidence.

### Next.js + NestJS direction

Next.js owns public/internal presentation and a selective BFF. NestJS owns PostgreSQL, domain rules, authorization, transactions, and audit. Implementation details remain open to reasoned refinement.

## 2026-08-02 — Group-session charge invariant

**Status:** Accepted

Each appointment participant may have at most one valid primary session charge.
An individual appointment has exactly one participant.

## 2026-08-02 — Therapist settlement basis

**Status:** Accepted

Therapist settlement is based on completed-session value and is independent of
whether or when the family pays.

Payment-to-charge allocation is therefore not required for therapist settlement.

Revisit payment allocation only if future requirements introduce insurance,
third-party payers, per-invoice payment, or another need to identify which
payment settled which charge.

## 2026-08-02 — Therapist share and discount allocation

**Status:** Accepted

Therapist settlement is based on completed-session value and is independent of
whether or when the family pays.

Therapist share percentages may differ by therapist and may change over time.
The percentage applied to a completed participant/session must be preserved as
a historical snapshot.

A family discount is split explicitly between the therapist and the clinic:

- therapist discount amount + clinic discount amount = total family discount;
- therapist net share = therapist gross share - therapist discount amount;
- clinic net share = clinic gross share - clinic discount amount;
- therapist net share must never be negative;
- the family's effective session charge must never be negative;
- clinic net share may be negative when the clinic explicitly bears a discount
  greater than its gross share.

For therapists who do not participate in discounts, therapist discount amount
is zero and the clinic bears the entire family discount, even when this produces
a negative clinic net.

A negative clinic net represents an explicit clinic subsidy or loss. It must be
visible in reports and preserve the applied split, actor, time, and reason.

Defaults may be defined per therapist. Any participant/session-level override
must be explicit, reasoned, and audited.

This decision supersedes any earlier wording that prohibited a negative clinic
net.

## 2026-08-02 — Money unit

**Status:** Accepted

Money is stored as integer **toman**, with no sub-unit, in `BIGINT` columns.

- **Alternatives:** rial.
- **Reason:** what the receptionist types equals what is stored and printed,
  removing a recurring order-of-magnitude entry error. Online payment is out of
  scope, so no gateway conversion is needed yet.
- **Trade-off:** a future payment gateway settles in rial and needs a documented
  conversion at that boundary.
- **Revisit when:** online payment enters scope.

## 2026-08-02 — Two-level appointment model

**Status:** Accepted

An appointment is the shared resource booking: one therapist, one room, one
service, one time range. An appointment participant is a child/family seat with
its own attendance outcome and price snapshot. An individual appointment has
exactly one participant; a group session has several.

- **Alternatives:** one appointment row per child with a shared group identifier.
- **Reason:** therapist and room overlap become plain exclusion constraints on a
  single booking row, and a group's time cannot drift across rows. Restructuring
  the appointment/charge spine after real financial history exists would be the
  most expensive migration in the project.
- **Trade-off:** one extra table and one join, paid from the first appointment
  milestone onward.
- **Revisit when:** group billing rules are approved and the group feature is
  built. The structure itself is settled.

Milestone 4 implements the structure; multi-participant booking UI and
group-specific features are deferred until explicitly approved.

## 2026-08-02 — ORM: Prisma

**Status:** Accepted

NestJS accesses PostgreSQL through Prisma. PostgreSQL-native constraints that
Prisma cannot express — partial unique indexes, `CHECK`, `EXCLUDE`, triggers —
are hand-written inside generated migration SQL and pinned by a test asserting
each constraint exists by name.

- **Alternatives:** TypeORM; a SQL-first query builder such as Kysely.
- **Reason:** migrations are plain, reviewable, checksummed SQL, which suits the
  review-before-apply workflow; generated types make omitted fields a compile
  error. TypeORM's advantages — declarative `CHECK`/`EXCLUDE`, locking helpers —
  are each a few lines of SQL, whereas its migration-generation weaknesses are
  not cheaply fixable.
- **Trade-off:** raw SQL for row locks and advanced constraints; the client is a
  single shared object, so module ownership of tables is a review convention.
- **Revisit when:** Prisma blocks a required PostgreSQL feature, or query
  overhead appears in reports.

Pinned to Prisma 6 rather than 7: Prisma 7 deprecates the `prisma-client-js`
generator in favour of an ESM-first generator, while NestJS compiles to
CommonJS, and the v7 CLI bundles Prisma Studio and an embedded database engine
that this project does not need. Revisit when the API moves to ESM or Prisma 6
leaves support.

## 2026-08-02 — Foundation stack and mechanical architecture boundary

**Status:** Accepted

pnpm workspace on Node 24; Next.js App Router and NestJS as the two
applications; PostgreSQL 17 via Docker Compose for development; Zod-validated
fail-fast environment configuration in both applications; ESLint flat config
with Prettier; Jest for the API and Vitest for the web application; GitHub
Actions CI running format, lint, boundary, typecheck, test, and build.

The rule that the web application never accesses PostgreSQL is enforced
mechanically rather than by convention:

- `apps/web` declares no database dependency and ESLint blocks importing one;
- the web environment schema declares no database connection string;
- the two applications have separate environment files. The root `.env` belongs
  to the API and holds the database connection string; `apps/web/.env.local`
  holds only `API_BASE_URL`. Nothing loads the root file into Next.js, so the
  connection string never enters the web process;
- CI scopes the database connection string to the single step that needs it,
  rather than defining it for the whole job;
- no catch-all API route may exist, so the BFF cannot become a generic proxy.

`pnpm check:boundary` verifies these in CI. It scans every hand-written file
under `apps/web` — source, build configuration and environment files, across all
module extensions — with no per-file exemptions, so the rule cannot be
documented or tested away.

- **Alternatives:** Turborepo for task orchestration; a single test runner; a
  generic proxy route for API access.
- **Reason:** two applications do not justify orchestration or caching
  infrastructure; Jest is the low-risk path for NestJS decorators and dependency
  injection, Vitest the natural fit for the web application; a boundary that is
  only documented eventually gets crossed.
- **Trade-off:** two test runners in one repository; CI reruns everything on
  every push.
- **Revisit when:** CI exceeds roughly five minutes, a third deployable appears,
  or maintaining two runners causes real friction.
